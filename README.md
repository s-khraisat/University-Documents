GOJO: Smart Tourism Experience & Cultural Guide (Jordan)

GOJO is a centralized web and mobile platform designed to solve the fragmented travel experience currently faced by tourists in Jordan. By integrating AI-powered planning with offline accessibility, GOJO provides a seamless journey from arrival to departure.




📖 Project Overview
Current tourism tools in Jordan are often unintegrated, forcing users to switch between multiple apps for maps, reviews, and site information. GOJO bridges this gap by focusing on a strategic competitive differentiator: an AI-Powered Itinerary Generator.





🚀 Planned Core Features

🤖 AI Itinerary Planning: Generates customized schedules based on user interests, budget, and trip duration.




📶 Offline Map Access: Essential for remote areas like Wadi Rum; users can download map tiles and site metadata to navigate without cellular signal.





🏛️ Cultural Guide: Provides "dos and don'ts" and etiquette tips to promote respectful tourism and cultural preservation.




🏢 Local Business Dashboard: Allows small Jordanian businesses and artisans to register and list services to increase their digital visibility.





🆘 Emergency Access: One-tap access to tourist police, medical services, and embassy locations.


🛠️ Technical Implementation (In Progress)
